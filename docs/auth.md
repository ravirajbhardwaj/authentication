# üîê Authentication & Authorization

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Overview

This document provides a detailed explanation of how **authentication** and **authorization** are implemented in this project. It covers the following aspects:

- **Why**: The importance of securing user data and controlling access to resources.
- **How**: The technical methods and tools used to implement authentication and authorization.
- **What**: The specific features and workflows enabled by these mechanisms.

By understanding these concepts, you can ensure robust security and a seamless user experience in your application.

### üî∏What is Identity?

Identity refers to the unique representation of a user or entity in a system. It is the foundation of authentication and authorization processes. In this project, identity is established using:

- **Unique Identifiers**: Such as email addresses, usernames, or user IDs.
- **Credentials**: Information like passwords, tokens, or biometric data used to verify identity.
- **Identity Providers (IdPs)**: External services (e.g., OAuth, OpenID Connect) that manage user identities and provide authentication.

By defining and managing identity, the system ensures that each user is uniquely identifiable and can be authenticated securely.

### üî∏ Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It ensures that only legitimate users can access the application. In this project, authentication is implemented to:

- **Identify users** securely by verifying their credentials (e.g., email, password, or tokens).
- **Protect user data** by requiring login before accessing sensitive information.
- **Enable user-specific features** such as personalized dashboards or settings.

By implementing authentication, the system ensures that users are who they claim to be, providing a secure foundation for further interactions.

### üî∏ Authorization

Authorization is the process of determining what actions a user is permitted to perform or what resources they can access. In this project, authorization is implemented to:

- **Restrict Access**: Ensure that only users with the appropriate roles or permissions can access specific features or data.
- **Prevent Unauthorized Actions**: Block actions such as modifying sensitive data or accessing admin-only features.
- **Enforce Security Policies**: Apply role-based or policy-based access control at the route, function, or resource level.
- **Enhance Application Security**: Minimize the risk of data breaches by limiting access to critical resources.

By implementing robust authorization mechanisms, the system ensures that users can only perform actions they are explicitly allowed to, maintaining both security and compliance.

## ü§î What‚Äôs the Difference?

| Feature        | Authentication (‡§™‡§π‡§ö‡§æ‡§®)    | Authorization (‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§Æ‡§§‡§ø)                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Definition     | Who are you?              | What are you allowed to do?               |
| Purpose        | Verifies identity (Login) | Access control (Permissions)              |
| Triggered When | User logs in              | User tries to access a protected resource |
| Data Used      | Email, password, tokens   | Roles, permissions                        |
| Comes First?   | ‚úÖ Yes                    | ‚ùå No ‚Äì comes after authentication        |
| Based on?      | Username, Password, OTP   | Roles, Policies, Access Rights            |
| Output/Example | User is logged in         | User can edit/delete                      |

## üßê Why We Use Authentication & Authorization

- **Security**: Protects sensitive data and resources from unauthorized access.
- **User Management**: Allows for personalized experiences and user-specific data access.
